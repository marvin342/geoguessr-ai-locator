# 🌍 GeoGuessr AI Locator
Built with Streamlit and GeoCLIP.

## How it works:
1. The user uploads a screenshot from Google Street View.
2. The **GeoCLIP** model analyzes the image's "geographic embeddings."
3. It compares the image to millions of coordinates to find the best match.
4. An interactive map displays the AI's best guess.
